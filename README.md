Hi! I'm MothAddict, but you can just call me Moth or Mice EN/PT/JP~/ES~
  Currently 21yo living in Jp #If you're reading this b4 2023 i'm prolly not there yet but my memory is worse than a golden fish's and i'm writing this early XD
I'm a programming enthusiast that has no clue of where i should go to learn but is trying a lot to get better.

I'm currently learning phyton, just started learning
Also, accepting teachers, tips and support in general, but nothing paid for now, i'm not anywhere close to good financial status to pay anyone for anything rn
